## Customizing VS Code Layout

You can customize the layout of VS Code to suit your workflow.

### Moving Views

You can move views, like the Chat view, to different locations. For example, to move the Chat view into the sidebar with the File Explorer:

1.  Find the **Chat** icon in the Activity Bar (the bar on the far left).
2.  Click and drag the icon over the File Explorer icon until you see a highlighted area in the sidebar.
3.  Drop the icon there. The Chat view will now appear as a section within the primary sidebar.

You can drag and drop most views to the primary sidebar, the secondary sidebar (if visible), or the bottom panel.
